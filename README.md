Galvanize Classified - Part 2

Read the entire README before beginning. Commit often.

Project Description

This is a simple Angular front end for your Galvanize Classified API. `Part 3 will involve styling, so keep it as simple as possible. We want to evaluate the Angular skills outside of styling.

Getting Started


Copy your files from **Part 2** into your project directory.  This is important: make sure you don't edit the part 2 files so we can evaluate each part independently.  This also allows you to redo pieces of this assessment individually.
